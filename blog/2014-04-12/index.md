Desiree Clary was the daughter of a wealthy merchant in Marseille. In her youth, she fell in love with Napoleon Bonaparte, who at the time was a low-ranking officer and financially struggling. Desiree often supported Napoleon, both emotionally and financially.

As years passed, Napoleon’s talent on the battlefield began to shine, and he rose to the rank of general. Ambitious and focused on his career, Napoleon decided to marry Josephine de Beauharnais, a wealthy widow with strong connections to senior French officials. He saw this union as a strategic move that would greatly benefit his aspirations.

Desiree learned about Napoleon’s wedding through the newspapers and was furious at his betrayal. In her anger, she stormed into the wedding and publicly confronted him, expressing her hurt and indignation.

Ironically, it was at this wedding that Desiree caught the attention of another French general, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. The two began courting and eventually married.

Meanwhile, Napoleon’s career soared, culminating in his crowning as Emperor of France. Despite his immense success, he began to regret his treatment of Desiree and the decisions that had separated them. According to some accounts, Napoleon even reached out to Desiree, asking if she would consider becoming the Queen of France.
