When I was a child, Spring Festival was a momentous occasion that filled me with excitement. Now, however, it feels more like any other holiday. This shift in perspective stems largely from how different life was back then.
One reason Spring Festival felt so special during my childhood was our economic situation. Growing up in a remote area of China, we lived modestly. While I never experienced famine, our daily food choices were limited, especially during winter when we mainly subsisted on rice, corn, potatoes, Chinese cabbage, and radishes. Other foods were available in the market, but they were too expensive for regular consumption. Meat appeared on our table occasionally, but not daily. Spring Festival was the one time of year when we could enjoy special dishes.
Today, all kinds of foods are readily available and much more affordable relative to income. There's little distinction between holiday meals and everyday dining.
If I were in China, I would visit my parents and celebrate the festival with them – that would make the holiday feel more meaningful and distinct. But here in US, it's not even a formal holiday.
