    The idea of what is a healthy family varied widely in different areas and periods.  For example, in the traditional Chinese culture, the healthy family is mostly probably a huge one.  An ideal family usually contains tens to hundreds of members, which made up of, at least, four generations.  But few modern people could suffer such healthy family.

  
    Despite of culture difference, we can find some common features from the healthy families.  To acknowledge why we human beings live in family units could be a good point to start of find those features.  Here are two basic reasons:  
    The first is to survive.  The strength of an individual is too limited.  It’s not even sufficient for defending himself and getting enough foods.  But the family, as a group, is more powerful.  So, members in a healthy family must respect and help each other, and cooperate with each other towards a same goal.  Obviously, surviving is only the first step.  We will search for a better life then.  A healthy family provides us a comfortable environment for it. And with the help of other family members, we could archive more accomplishment.  
    The second is to multiply.  Our parents bring us to this world, and breed us up.  We have enjoyed our rights, so we must take our responsibility.  And the responsibility is to bear and foster our offspring.  So a healthy family should have some kids.

  
    A healthy family is a harmonious, cozy and aggressive one.  Every member in the family feels happy.  But it is still not enough.  A healthy family must take its responsibilities to gain the respect.
