    If you ask me, the answer is YES.  I am always eager to own a personal car.  Don’t you have the same dream?  
    Many people are against owning private cars because of some obvious reasons, such as air pollution, noise, traffic jams, and resource waste.  But I don’t think that any of the above issues belong to the automobile uniquely.  It is the industrialization that has brought us all of the problems.  Why don’t we just stay in the agricultural society to avoid those troubles?  
    We should not always focus on the disadvantages of the cars but overlook their contributions and our great capabilities of overcoming the problems.  Some cars have already adopted fuel batteries instead of gas engines.  Cars will hardly generate any pollution when hydrogen replaces gasoline as the fuel.  With cars, we run into traffic jam sometimes, but without cars, we will have to be congested at downtown all day long.  We all dream of the rusticity, but without the car, life in the suburb is just a tragedy.  Cars provide us much more convenience than troubles.  
    The automobile industry will contribute to our national economy enormously, just like what it has done for the American economy.  As one of the mainstay industries, the auto industry will accelerate the progress of mining, manufacturing, capital construction, and other related domain.  It will also provide tremendous employment opportunities.  Domestic demand is playing a more important role in Chinese economy more than ever before.  Private cars are the best stimulus of the demand expansion.  
    A private car is a symbol of freedom of individuals, and also an index of development level of a nation.  There is no doubt that our government must encourage the development of private cars.
