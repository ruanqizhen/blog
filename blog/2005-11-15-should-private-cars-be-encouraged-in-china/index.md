My answer is YES. I have always dreamed of owning a personal car. Don’t you share the same dream?

Many people oppose private car ownership, citing issues like air pollution, noise, traffic congestion, and resource depletion. However, I believe these problems are not exclusive to automobiles. They are the byproducts of industrialization as a whole. If we were to avoid all such problems, should we regress to an agricultural society instead?

Rather than fixating on the drawbacks of cars, we should acknowledge their contributions and focus on our ability to solve the associated challenges. For example, some cars now use fuel cells instead of traditional gas engines, significantly reducing emissions. As technology advances, hydrogen may eventually replace gasoline, eliminating pollution from cars altogether.

It’s true that cars sometimes lead to traffic jams, but without them, people would be stuck in congested urban areas all day. While we might dream of a rustic lifestyle, living in the suburbs without a car can be incredibly inconvenient. Cars provide far more advantages than disadvantages, offering freedom, mobility, and convenience.

Moreover, the automobile industry can significantly boost our national economy, just as it did in the United States. As a cornerstone industry, it stimulates the development of mining, manufacturing, infrastructure, and other related sectors. It also creates countless employment opportunities. At a time when domestic demand is becoming increasingly crucial for China’s economic growth, private car ownership can serve as a powerful driver for demand expansion.

A private car is not just a mode of transportation—it symbolizes individual freedom and reflects a nation’s level of development. Encouraging private car ownership aligns with progress and modernization. There is no doubt that our government should support and promote the development of private cars.
