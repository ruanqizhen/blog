I started swimming at the recreation center in our town last month. One challenge I faced was knowing the time while swimming. Since I’m nearsighted, I can’t see the clocks in the pool without my glasses. So, I decided to buy a watch.

I had two options: a mechanical watch or an electric one. Electric watches are cheaper and very accurate, but they don’t last as long. The average lifespan of an electric watch is about 10 years, and even the more expensive ones typically last no more than 20 years.

On the other hand, high-quality mechanical watches can last much longer—some of the best have been running for over a hundred years. However, they’re far too expensive for me. Even if I bought a new electric watch every 10 years for the next 50 years, it would still cost less than one good mechanical watch.

In the end, I decided to buy an electric watch, and I’m very happy with it.
