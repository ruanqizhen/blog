    The majority of Chinese families now have only one child since the one-child policy has been in place for nearly 20 years.  By the year 2001, there was already 240 million “only children”, which is about the population of the United States.  In the next couple decades, the “only children” generation will become the elite of our society.  No one knows how much he or she will change the world.  
    As the only child in the family, he or she received more elaborately attendance, sometimes, even indulgence.  Parents always try hard to fulfill each of his or her requests.  Those children, who are called as “little emperor”, are in the danger of being spoilt, over pampered and self-centered.  
    As the center of the families, the kids, without any siblings, still feel lonely, which is the origin of many kinds of psychological illness.  Neither the parents nor the classmates can take place of the role of brothers and sisters.  
Seems the “only children” are still not ready to take their responsibilities.  Some elder “only children” has already graduated from universities.  But they still can’t be independent from their parents.  The “only children” usually require longer period to season the change in their career, because they were brought up in a more sheltered and more dependent environment.  
    When their parents have been retired, a couple of “only children” will have four parents and even more grandparents to look after.  It will surely be a disaster if we don’t well prepared to face it.
