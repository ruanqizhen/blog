The majority of Chinese families now have only one child, thanks to the one-child policy that has been in place for nearly 20 years. By 2001, there were already 240 million “only children” in China—a population roughly equivalent to that of the United States. In the coming decades, this generation of “only children” will rise to become the elite of society, and their influence on the world remains to be seen.

As the sole child in their families, these children often receive more focused attention, and in some cases, indulgence. Parents strive to meet their every demand, sometimes at the risk of spoiling them. These children, often referred to as “little emperors”, face the danger of becoming over-pampered, self-centered, and unaccustomed to adversity.

Despite being the center of attention in their families, many of these children experience loneliness due to the absence of siblings. This loneliness can lead to various psychological challenges. While parents and classmates can provide companionship, they cannot fully replace the unique bond and role that siblings play.

Moreover, many “only children” struggle with transitioning into adulthood and assuming their responsibilities. Some older “only children” have already graduated from university but remain dependent on their parents. This generation often requires more time to adapt to the demands of their careers and independent living, largely because they were raised in a more sheltered and dependent environment.

A significant challenge looms on the horizon for these “only children”. As they age, married couples from this generation will face the responsibility of caring for four parents—and potentially even more grandparents. Without adequate preparation and systemic support, this situation could lead to serious social and familial strain.
