“The Malthusian trap, or population trap, is a condition where excess population growth is curtailed by food shortages, leading to starvation.” — Wikipedia

Before 1800, famine was a persistent threat to people worldwide. Despite significant increases in food production throughout history, humanity remained trapped in cycles of starvation. This occurred because any surplus food would lead to higher birth rates, eventually pushing the population back to the brink of hunger.

For example, high-yield crops from the Americas, such as maize and sweet potatoes, were introduced to China around 1600. While these crops helped sustain a larger population, they did not eliminate famine. Instead, China's population tripled within a century, once again straining resources.

The situation began to change after 1800, as many countries broke free from the Malthusian Trap. Two key factors contributed to this transformation:

Technological Advancements: The development of modern technologies, including machinery, fertilizers, and improved agricultural methods, allowed food production to outpace population growth.

Population Control: Perhaps even more crucially, birth rates began to decline as societies adopted practices and policies to manage population growth. For the first time, the rate of population increase slowed, falling below the rate of food production growth.

Together, these factors ushered in a new era where famine became less of an inevitable reality for many parts of the world.
